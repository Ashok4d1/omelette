            The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidance neccessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people.
